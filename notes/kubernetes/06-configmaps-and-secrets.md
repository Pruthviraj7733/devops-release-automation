# Chapter 06 — ConfigMaps and Secrets

**Learning path:** Theory → Architecture → Practical → Practice Tasks → Interview Answer

> Study material, not evidence of deployment in this repository. Run commands only against a disposable practice cluster. The project's EKS cluster and ALB were deleted after testing to prevent charges.

## 1. Theory

ConfigMaps store non-confidential configuration as key/value data; Secrets store sensitive values but are not automatically secure just because they are base64-encoded. Enable encryption at rest, restrict RBAC access, avoid committing secret values, and consider external secret managers. Values can be consumed through environment variables or mounted volumes; updates have different propagation behavior.

## 2. Architecture and request flow

  A[Developer or kubectl] --> B[Kubernetes API]
  B --> C[Desired State]
  C --> D[Controllers and Scheduler]
  D --> E[Worker Nodes and Pods]
  E --> F[Observe and Verify]
```

**Apply to this chapter:** ConfigMaps and Secrets fits into the API-driven desired-state model. Distinguish control-plane operations from the workload resources running on nodes.

## 3. Essential concepts

- **Desired state:** Declarative configuration stored through the Kubernetes API.
- **Actual state:** What is currently running; controllers work to reconcile differences.
- **Namespaces and labels:** Scope resources and identify selected workloads.
- **Operational verification:** Inspect resource status, events, logs and readiness instead of assuming success.
- **Project context:** Review the existing [Jenkinsfile](../../Jenkinsfile) and [Kubernetes manifests](../../k8s/) to distinguish implemented features from study-only topics.

## 4. Hands-on practical

Replace placeholders such as `<NODE_NAME>` with real names. Some commands require metrics-server, an appropriate cluster or permissions.

```bash
kubectl create configmap study-config --from-literal=MODE=practice
kubectl get configmap study-config -o yaml
kubectl describe configmap study-config
kubectl delete configmap study-config
# Do not put real credentials into practice commands or Git
```

**Safety:** Read commands before execution; creation/deletion examples should be run only in a dedicated practice environment. Cloud resources and storage may incur costs.

## 5. Practice tasks

- [ ] Summarize the theory in your notebook without copying the entire section.
- [ ] Create a ConfigMap and identify data vs metadata; write a sample Pod YAML consuming MODE from configMapKeyRef; explain why base64 is not encryption.
- [ ] Identify the relevant Kubernetes objects and their relationships.
- [ ] Explain one failure mode and the commands you would use to diagnose it.
- [ ] Describe what is implemented in this project versus what is only studied here.

## 6. Interview preparation

**Q: ConfigMap versus Secret?**

**Sample answer:** ConfigMaps are for non-sensitive application settings. Secrets are API objects for confidential values, but need proper RBAC, encryption at rest and careful handling. Neither is currently implemented in this project's application manifests.

**Follow-up:** What output would you inspect to verify the behavior in a real cluster?

## 7. Revision checklist

- [ ] Explain the concept in under two minutes.
- [ ] Identify the Kubernetes API objects involved.
- [ ] Recall at least three practical commands.
- [ ] Explain a failure scenario and a verification step.
